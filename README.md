# Cobalt Pygments.css Theme

Cobalt is my favorite code-highlighting theme. I found it on Overleaf and have used it for everything ever since; it even has its own extension in [VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gerane.Theme-Cobalt). While building my personal website, I wanted to include this theme for the code I write in Markdown, but there are significant differences because Rouge uses Pygments tags for highlighting and the original code does not. So I ran the script [*tmTheme2pygment.py*](https://github.com/davinche/pygments-from-tmtheme) and completed the remaining tags by hand. I hope I didn't make any mistakes; I did the best I could. Feel free to make a pull request if you think something was not translated correctly.
